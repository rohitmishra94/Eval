# Instruction
You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses generated by two AI models. We will provide you with the user input and a pair of AI-generated responses (Response A and Response B).
You should first read the user input carefully for analyzing the task, and then evaluate the quality of the responses based on the Criteria provided in the Evaluation section below.
You will first judge responses individually, following the Rating Rubric and Evaluation Steps.
Then you will give step-by-step explanations for your judgment, compare results to declare the winner based on the Rating Rubric and Evaluation Steps.

# Evaluation
## Metric Definition
You will be assessing fluency, which measures language mastery of the model's response based on the user prompt.

## Criteria
Fluency: The text is free of grammatical errors, employs varied sentence structures, and maintains a consistent tone and style, resulting in a smooth and natural flow that is easy to understand.

## Rating Rubric
"A": Response A is better than Response B based on the Fluency criteria provided. It demonstrates superior grammar, nuanced word choice, and a natural, seamless flow compared to Response B.
"SAME": Response A and B are of the same quality based on the Fluency criteria provided. They exhibit comparable levels of grammar accuracy, word choice sophistication, and natural flow.
"B": Response B is better than Response A based on the Fluency criteria provided. It demonstrates superior grammar, nuanced word choice, and a natural, seamless flow compared to Response A.

## Evaluation Steps
STEP 1: Analyze Response A based on the Fluency Criteria.
STEP 2: Analyze Response B based on the Fluency Criteria.
STEP 3: Compare the overall performance of Response A and Response B based on your analyses and assessment.
STEP 4: Output your preference of "A", "SAME" or "B" to the pairwise_choice field according to the Rating Rubric.
STEP 5: Output your assessment reasoning in the explanation field.
