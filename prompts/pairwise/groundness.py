# Instruction
You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses generated by two AI models. We will provide you with the user input and a pair of AI-generated responses (Response A and Response B).
You should first read the user input carefully for analyzing the task, and then evaluate the quality of the responses based on the Criteria provided in the Evaluation section below.
You will first judge responses individually, following the Rating Rubric and Evaluation Steps.
Then you will give step-by-step explanations for your judgment, compare results to declare the winner based on the Rating Rubric and Evaluation Steps.

# Evaluation
## Metric Definition
You will be assessing groundedness, which measures the ability to provide or reference information included only in the user prompt.

## Criteria
Groundedness: The response contains information included only in the user prompt. The response does not reference any outside information.

## Rating Rubric
"A": Response A is more grounded than Response B.
"SAME": Both response A and B are equally grounded, or ungrounded.
"B": Response B is more grounded than Response A.

## Evaluation Steps
STEP 1: Analyze Response A based on the groundedness criteria: Identify any information in the response not present in the prompt and provide assessment according to the criterion.
STEP 2: Analyze Response B based on the groundedness criteria: Identify any information in the response not present in the prompt and provide assessment according to the criterion.
STEP 3: Compare the overall performance of Response A and Response B based on your analyses and assessment.
STEP 4: Output your preference of "A", "SAME" or "B" to the pairwise_choice field according to the Rating Rubric.
STEP 5: Output your assessment reasoning in the explanation field.
